# VSociety Open Source

A lightweight and simplified version of my main Discord bot, built using `discord.py`. This bot provides basic moderation, role management, and protection systems while maintaining minimal dependencies and an easy-to-configure setup.

## Features

- 🚀 **Basic Moderation**: Kick, ban, and warn users.
- ❗ **Protection Systems**: Anti-Advertising, Protect your roles and more.
- 🛠️ **Utility Commands**: Fetch user info, server stats, and more.
- 🔒 **Owner-Only Commands**: Restricted commands for bot owner.
- 📂 **JSON-Based Configuration**: Easily modify settings without a database.
